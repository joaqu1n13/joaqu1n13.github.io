I'm a first year computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite cpsc 120L Labs

Lab 7 - Lab 7 was one of my favorites because it just happened to be the lab where I think I wrote the most code. I thought the concept of only writing the functions for each streetâ€™s available hours and seeing it work with the main coding file was a bit challenging but satisfying when I got it to all work completely.

Lab 1 - I would call lab 1 my favorite because even though it was the easiest possible lab where all we had to do was change the hello world sentence to have our names, it will probably be nostalgic for me for the rest of my career. The reason being because I had no idea how to do anything and I spent the whole time being confused about how to work the linux terminal.

Lab 4 part 2 - This one was one of my favorites because it was a simple but still challenging for me at the time because of how new I was and still am to programming in C++. I did the second part on my own and it felt good to play the number guessing game and see it actually function properly.
